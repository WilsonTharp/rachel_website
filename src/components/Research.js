        <h1>Research Statement</h1>
        <p>number and complexity of notational systems designed for specific applications, including neums and <em>positurae, </em>two systems that feature the slash mark. Eventually, the virgule would become a common punctuation mark in fourteenth-, fifteenth-, and sixteenth-century Middle English poetry, including in the earliest surviving copies of <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>. The mark can still be seen in early printed editions until it is effectively replaced by the comma in the mid-sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The history of the virgule is indicative of how readers theorized, categorized, and adopted novel signs to meet their interpretive needs until those needs were met by scribes, editors, and authors. The significance of this argument is twofold: first, punctuation historically functions as a record of readers’ and eventually scribes’ interpretations; second, punctuation trends are influenced by the same forces acting upon scripts, including purpose of use, comprehensibility of writing, treatment of exemplars, and demand for copies. The dissertation recontextualizes the idiosyncratic features of texts as our most valuable insights into the history of manuscript reception and production.</p>

<p>The second chapter of the dissertation, “Ancient Origins of Interpretation is under review with <em>PMLA</em> and the first, “Reading Unseparated Text,” is in preparation for submission to <em>Medium Aevum. </em>I presented “The Ancient Origins of the Virgule” at the 2021 International Medieval Congress and “The Virgule in Context” at the 2019 Mid-America Medieval Association Annual Symposium from this research. My paper “Innovation and Exemplars: The Virgule’s Role in Insular Book Production During the Eighth and Ninth Centuries” has been accepted to the 2022 International Congress on Medieval Studies. I will submit a book proposal in May 2022 with the goal of publishing by May 2025. My dissertation has been supported by the Rudolf C. Bambas Memorial Scholarship and a dissertation fellowship.</p>

<p>A second research project on the virgule has been funded by the Derdeyn-CMRS Travel Scholarship. On one of Geoffrey Chaucer’s two trips to Italy in the 1370s, he acquired a copy of Giovanni Boccaccio’s <em>Filostrato </em>and <em>Teseida. </em>While both influenced Chaucer, <em>Il Teseida </em>is a known source of Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale. Though Boccaccio’s repertory of punctuation varied, he applied the virgule to a copy of a Latin translation of Aristotle’s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>. If the virgule appears in Chaucer’s copy of <em>Il Teseida, </em>now housed at the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, we may have cause to believe the virgules in the earliest copies of the <em>Canterbury Tales </em>were copied from an autograph and Boccaccio’s influence on Chaucer included punctuation. I will propose my findings as a paper at the 2023 Conference of the Early Book Society and submit an article to <em>Studies in the Age of Chaucer </em>in August of 2022. </p>

<p>Additionally, I am seeking funding for a project to digitize, transcribe, and make available John Manly and Edith Rickert’s collation cards currently split between the University of Chicago and University of Oklahoma libraries. The cards record variations among all the extant manuscripts and Caxton’s two prints of the <em>Canterbury Tales</em>. Unfortunately, the data on these cards is not always represented accurately in Manly and Rickert’s eight-volume <em>The Text of the</em> <em>Canterbury Tales, </em>which theoretically reconstructs the oldest and least corrupted version of Chaucer’s work. The cards not only permit correction of the published record of variants, they also contain occasional notes that do not appear in Manly and Rickert’s edition. Thus the cards are an essential supplement to the eight published volumes. I will present a trial website featuring images of the cards at the 2022 New Chaucer Society Congress and submit an article for publication in <em>Studies in the Age of Chaucer </em>that defends the accuracy of Manly and Rickert’s edition when supplemented with the website. Investigating the earliest interpretations of Chaucer’s work expands our knowledge of how Chaucer’s drafts first appeared, exposing how much decision-making power authors had over the design and dissemination of their work in the Late Middle Ages.</p>
