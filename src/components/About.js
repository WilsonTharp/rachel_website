        Rachel Tharp is a fifth-year PhD candidate longing for free time. She studies punctuation trends in Latin, Italian, and English from the first century CE to the eighteenth at the University of Oklahoma. If she’s not appeasing her (very) loud cats, you’ll find her in the kitchen, obsessively curating menus, outside, defending her feeble garden from the encroaching wildlife, or on the couch, yelling at the TV with her endlessly supportive husband and partner of twelve years, Wilson Tharp.
